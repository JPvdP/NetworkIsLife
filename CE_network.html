<p>The network is created from co-authorship from publications written between 2010 and 2024. Only published articles and books were selected from the Scopus database.</p>
<p>Affiliation were obtained from scopus in a raw format (hence the many variations in the list), some small cleaning steps were taken to identify universities and tag researchers from copernicus.</p>
